## Overview
The application uses two API’s to consume data, the two chosen were Ticketmaster and ACU Weather’s API. The purpose of this app is to allow users to find events from around the world by inputting a city name along with a start date and end date. Once a search is made all the events for that city within the dates specified will be displayed along with the current weather conditions.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Search for events by city name and dates
- See relevant event information based on their search
- Click on an individual event to display more information in a modal
